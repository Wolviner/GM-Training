                <h3>Fiji's Womens Are Living the Reality of Climate Change</h3>
                <p>On November 6, Brianna Fruean and other Pacific Islands representatives marched in Glasgow as all
                    eyes
                    are on <img src="assets/fiji_news.jpg" height="200" width="260">
                    the United Kingdom for the COP26 climate change summit happening this month. The chilly streets of
                    Scotland
                    and its winter are so far removed from the reality of the Pacific that we, in the Southern
                    Hemisphere,
                    can
                    neither fathom nor imagine the cold. Unfortunately, the discussions at COP26 are similarly removed
                    from
                    the
                    climate realities faced by Fijian women.</p>

                <h3>Health care in America is the Best in the World</h3>
                <p>There is an aphorism that all budding entrepreneurs and grizzled veterans alike come to intimately
                    understand: the market never lies. Americans have among the lowest life expectancy of high-income
                    countries. <img src="assets/hospital-gif-news.gif" height="200" width="270">
                    — 77.3 years versus Switzerland, for example, at 83.2 years. The adult chronic disease burden stands
                    at
                    24.6% of the population, compared to an average of 18% across these same countries. Obesity defined
                    as a
                    BMI
                    of 30 or more is at a staggering 40% in the United States, compared to an average of 21% in the
                    group.

                <h3>The Roots of the Israeil-Palestinian Conflict</h3>
                <p> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has waxed and waned for several decades. The roots of it stem far
                    beyond
                    the most recent clashes in May that once again brought death and disaster to the region. The
                    question
                    arises: How far back do we look for an explanation of the current violence? <img
                        src="assets/palestinian_news.jpg" height="200px" width="270px"> <br> Do we start with the
                    1967
                    conflict that resulted in Israel occupying Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, along with the
                    Golan
                    Heights and the Sinai Peninsula? Or do we go back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War — what the Israelis
                    call
                    the
                    War of Independence and the Palestinians the Nakba, or catastrophe? Or do we need to rewind further
                    back
                    to
                    the 1917 Balfour Declaration, a British letter of intent for “the establishment in Palestine of a
                    national
                    home for the Jewish people”? Or do we go all the way to the First Zionist Congress, convened in
                    Basel,
                    Switzerland, in 1897 amidst a wave of anti-Semitism rising across Europe? <br> The debate about the
                    origins
                    of the conflict goes on to this day. Regardless of the debate, the current situation in Israel and
                    the
                    Palestinian Territories has become unsustainable.</p>

                <h3>Youth Gangs and the White Power Movement</h3>
                <p>Shannon Reid, an associate professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of North
                    Carolina at Charlotte, joins this episode of “Right Rising.” She discusses youth gang activism
                    within
                    the white power movement in the US and our historical and contemporary conceptions of gang activity.
                    <img src="assets/WhitePower_movement_news.jpg" height="200px" width="260px">
                    Along with host Augusta Dell’Omo, she walks us through the geography of white power gangs and gives
                    us
                    insight into what drives youths to join these gangs. Bringing her own experiences working with youth
                    gangs, Reid offers some suggestions about what kinds of interventions may — or may not — be useful
                    when
                    working with white power youth.

                <h3>Fast fashion? No thanks. I care about our planet Earth.</h3>
                <p>The $2.7-trillion fashion industry is one of the largest, most resource-intensive sectors in the
                    global
                    economy, and it has a devastating impact on our environment.
                    <img src="assets/Fast-fashion-news.jpg" height="200px" width="260px">
                    The extraordinary success of “fast fashion” giants like H&M, Zara and Forever 21 stems from their
                    ability to produce a massive amount of clothing — billions of garments a year — in the cheapest and
                    quickest manner possible. An article of clothing often travels through dozens of countries and
                    hundreds
                    of hands, and ends up being worn only a few times.
